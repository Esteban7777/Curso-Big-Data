   abstract = {House sales are determined based on the Standard & Poor's Case-Shiller home price indices and the housing price index of the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO). These reflect the trends of the US housing market. In addition to these housing price indices, the development of a housing price prediction model can greatly assist in the prediction of future housing prices and the establishment of real estate policies. This study uses machine learning algorithms as a research methodology to develop a housing price prediction model. To improve the accuracy of housing price prediction, this paper analyzes the housing data of 5359 townhouses in Fairfax County, Virginia, gathered by the Multiple Listing Service (MLS) of the Metropolitan Regional Information Systems (MRIS). We develop a housing price prediction model based on machine learning algorithms such as C4.5, RIPPER, Naïve Bayesian, and AdaBoost and compare their classification accuracy performance. We then propose an improved housing price prediction model to assist a house seller or a real estate agent make better informed decisions based on house price valuation. The experiments demonstrate that the RIPPER algorithm, based on accuracy, consistently outperforms the other models in the performance of housing price prediction.},

   abstract = {Developing an accurate prediction model for housing prices is always needed for socioeconomic development and well-being of citizens. In this paper, a diverse set of machine learning algorithms such as XGBoost, CatBoost, Random Forest, Lasso, Voting Regressor, and others, are being employed to predict the housing prices using public available datasets. The housing datasets of 62,723 records from January 2015 to November 2019 is obtained from the Florida's Volusia County Property Appraiser website. The records are publicly available and include the real estate/economic database, maps, and other associated information. The database is usually updated weekly according to the State of Florida regulations. Then, the housing price prediction models using machine learning techniques are developed and their regression model performances are compared. Finally, an improved housing price prediction model for assisting the housing market is proposed. Particularly, a house seller/buyer or a real estate broker can get insight in making better-informed decisions considering the housing price prediction. The empirical results illustrate that based on prediction model performance, Coefficient of Determination (R 2), Mean Square Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and computational time, the XGBoost algorithm performs superior than the other models to predict the housing price.},

   abstract = {There is an urgent need to forecast real estate unit prices because the average price of residential real estate is always fluctuating. This paper provides a real estate price prediction model based on supervised regression deep learning with 3 hidden layers, a Relu activation function, 100 neurons, and a Root Mean Square Propagation optimizer (RMS Prop). The model was developed using actual data collected from 28 Egyptian cities between 2014 and 2022. The model can forecast the price of a real estate unit based on 27 different variables. The model is created in two stages: adjusting the parameters to obtain the best ones using a sensitivity k-fold technique, then optimizing the result. 85 percent of the real estate unit data gathered was used in training and developing the model, while the other 15 percent was used in validating and testing. By using a dropout regularization technique of 0.60 on the model layers, the final developed model had a maximum error of 10.58%. After validation, the model had a maximum error of about 9.50%. A graphical user interface (GUI) tool is developed to make use of the final predictive model, which is very simple for real estate developers and decision-makers to use.},

   abstract = {The close relationship between collateral value and bank stability has led to a considerable need to a rapid and economical appraisal of real estate.The greater availability of information related to housing stock has prompted to the use of so-called big data and machine learning in the estimation of property prices. Although this methodology has already been applied to the real estate market to identify which variables influence dwelling prices, its use for estimating the price of properties is not so frequent. The application of this methodology has become more sophisticated over time, from applying simple methods to using the socalled ensemble methods and, while the estimation capacity has improved, it has only been applied to specific geographical areas. The main contribution of this article lies in developing an application for the entire Spanish market that fully automatically provides the best model for each municipality. Real estate property prices in 433 municipalities are estimated from a sample of 790,631 dwellings, using different ensemble methods based on decision trees such as bagging, boosting, and random forest.The results for estimating the price of dwellings show a good performance of the techniques developed, in terms of the error measures, with the best results being achieved using the techniques of bagging and random forest.},

Then, the author establishes a multiple linear regression model for housing price prediction and applies the data set of real estate prices in Boston to test the method. Through the data analysis and test in this paper, it can be summarized that the multiple linear regression model can effectively predict and analyze the housing price to some extent, while the algorithm can still be improved through more advanced machine learning methods.},

@article{Choy2023,
   abstract = {<p>This research seeks to demonstrate how machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence, is able to deliver more accurate pricing predictions, using the real estate market as an example. Utilizing 24,936 housing transaction records, this paper employs Extra Trees (ET), k–Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Random Forest (RF) to predict property prices and then compares their results with those of a hedonic price model. In particular, this paper uses a feature (property age x square footage) instead of property age in order to isolate the effect of land depreciation on property prices. Our results suggest that these three algorithms markedly outperform the traditional statistical techniques in terms of explanatory power and error minimization. Machine learning is expected to play an increasing role in shaping our future. However, it may raise questions about the privacy, fairness, and job displacement issues. It is therefore important to pay close attention to the ethical implications of machine learning and ensure that the technology is used responsibly and ethically. Researchers, legislators, and industry players must work together to create appropriate standards and legislation to govern the use of machine learning.</p>},
